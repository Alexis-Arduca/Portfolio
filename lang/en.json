    "This game was developed as part of a group project at Saxion University of Applied Sciences, in the Netherlands.",
    "I worked alongside game designers and 2D/3D artists to create a game for a younger audience, based on monsters imagined by children from a partner school.",
    "The goal was to design a fun and accessible game, faithful to the universe created by the children, while providing a coherent gameplay experience.",
